Think of it as a second brain to help you make sense of all the information you care about. Some potential use cases include: . | project management | personal knowledge base of things you‚Äôve learned | CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies | recipe book | . Click here to see an example of Dendron in action. ",

Every knowledge management tool today suffers from the problem of information overload - the more information you put in, the harder it becomes, as a human, to get any of it back out again. The burning need for a tool that would not only overcome this problem but actually work better in the presence of more information was the basis of this project. ",

This is because there are few things as effective as a multi-level hiearchy for quickly filtering an overwhelming amount of information to something humans can work with. You can read this blog post for the extended rationale behind this. In Dendron, you can quickly lookup related notes by their hierarchy. Hierarchies are simply . delimited filenames, similar to the hierarchies made by domain names (eg. github.com). The following are a few notes that have this hierarchical naming format. - cli.tar.md - cli.tar.env.md - cli.curl.md - cli.dig.md . ",

    "hpath": "dendron",
    "content": "If you‚Äôre paying close attention, you might have noticed some icons popup during lookup. These icons indicate the schema associated with the note. Think of schemas as an optional type system for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. You can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme {name}.schema.yml to your workspace. Below is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don‚Äôt need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following glob patterns: cli.*, cli.*.cmd, cli.*.cmd.*, cli.*.env . - id: cli desc: command line interface reference parent: root data: namespace: true children: - cmd - env - id: env desc: variables relevant for command - id: cmd desc: subcommands data: namespace: true . Schemas help you organize your notes by letting you know what comes next. The + sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note does not exist but is part of the schema. Schema suggestions don‚Äôt show you an endless lineup of tags or folders - they only show you suggestions scoped to your specific level of the hierarchy that you are looking at. The nice thing about these suggestions is that you can also ignore them. Sometimes rules schemas are meant to be broken . Dendron will show you a ? next to the result in future results but otherwise will assume that you know best. ",

    "hpath": "dendron.concepts",
    "content": "Below are some concepts that are helpful to know when using Dendron. Note that features with üöß are still under active development and might not be fully implemented. Markdown . Dendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax here. Frontmatter . Frontmatter is YAML that you can add to the front of your markdown file. It was first introduced by jekyll and is a convenient way of adding metadata to your plaintext documents. You can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron here . Workspace . In Dendron, your workspace is the root of where all your files are located. It‚Äôs definde by the dendron.rootDir property and created when you first run Dendron: Initialize Workspace . Vaults üöß . Your workspace is made up of vaults. You can think of a vault like a git repository. By default, Dendron creates a vault.main folder when you first initialize a workspace. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis. ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault.main ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foo.md ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foo.one.md ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foo.two.md ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vault.secret (hypothetical) ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secret.one.md ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secret.two.md . By default, when you look for notes in dendron, it will search over all vaults. Hierarchies . Within a vault, your notes are stored hierarchically as . delimited markdown files. Below is a hypothetical hierarchy for a file tree: . ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/designs/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/designs/promotion.png ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/paperwork/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/paperwork/legal.md ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/tasks/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/tasks/task1.md ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1/tasks/task2.md . The same hiearchy in Dendron would look like the following: . ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.designs.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.designs.promotion.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.paperwork.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.paperwork.legal.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.tasks.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.tasks.task1.md ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.tasks.task2.md . You can read more about hierarchies here . Domain . A domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, project1 would be the domain. ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.designs.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.designs.promotion.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.paperwork.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.paperwork.legal.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.tasks.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.tasks.task1.md ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project1.tasks.task2.md . Schema . As you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has schemas to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an optional type system for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. You can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme {name}.schema.yml to your workspace. Below is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don‚Äôt need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following glob patterns: cli.*, cli.*.cmd, cli.*.cmd.*, cli.*.env . - id: cli desc: command line interface reference parent: root data: namespace: true children: - cmd - env - id: env desc: variables relevant for command - id: cmd desc: subcommands data: namespace: true . Command Bar . The command bar is native to vscode. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with Dendron:. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar. | &lt;img src=‚Äùhttps://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png‚Äù width=16 height=16/&gt; Linux Ctrl+SHIFT+P | &lt;img src=‚Äùhttps://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico‚Äù width=16 height=16/&gt; macOS ‚åò+SHIFT+P | &lt;img src=‚Äùhttps://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico‚Äù width=16 height=16/&gt; Windows Ctrl+SHIFT+P | . Lookup Bar . The lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type &gt; Dendron: Lookup in the Command Bar or use the CTRL+L shortcut. | &lt;img src=‚Äùhttps://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png‚Äù width=16 height=16/&gt; Linux CTRL+L | &lt;img src=‚Äùhttps://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico‚Äù width=16 height=16/&gt; macOS CMD+L | &lt;img src=‚Äùhttps://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico‚Äù width=16 height=16/&gt; Windows CTRL+L | .
